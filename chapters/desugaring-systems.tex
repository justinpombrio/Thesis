\Desc{Discussion}
The C Preprocessor (hereafter \textsc{cpp}) [CITE] is a \emph{text
  preprocessor}: a source-to-source transformation that operates at
the level of text. (More precisely, it operates on a token stream, in
which the tokens are approximately those of the C language). It is
usually run before compilation for C or C++ programs, but it is not
very language specific, and can be used for other purposes as well.
\textsc{Cpp} is not Turing complete, by a simple mechanism: if a macro
invokes itself (directly or indirectly), the recursive invocation
will not be expanded.

A number of issues arise from the fact that \textsc{cpp} operates on tokens, and
is thus unaware of the higher-level syntax of C [CITE].
As an example, consider this innocent looking
\textsc{cpp} desugaring rule that defines an alias for subtraction:
\begin{Codes}
  #define SUB(a, b) a - b
\end{Codes}
This rule is completely broken. Suppose it is used as follows:
\begin{Codes}
  SUB(0, 2 - 1))
\end{Codes}
This will expand to \Code{0 - 2 - 1} and evaluate to \Code{-3}.
We can revise the rule to fix this:
\begin{Codes}
  #define SUB(a, b) (a) - (b)
\end{Codes}
This will fix the last example, but it is still broken. Consider:
\begin{Codes}
  SUB(5, 3) * 2
\end{Codes}
This will expand to \Code{5 - 3 * 2} and evaluate to \Code{-1}.
The rule can be fully fixed by another set of parentheses:
\begin{Codes}
  #define SUB(a, b) ((a) - (b))
\end{Codes}
In general, both the inside boundary of a rule (the arguments \Code{a}
and \Code{b}), and the outside boundary (the whole \textsc{rhs}) need
to be protected to ensure that the expansion is parsed correctly. If
the sugar is used in expression position, as in the \Code{SUB}
example, this can be done with parentheses. In other positions,
different tricks must be used: e.g., a rule meant to be used in
statement position can be wrapped in \Code{do \{...\} while(0)}.
Software developers should not need to know this.

There are other issues that arise with text-based transformations as
well, such as variable capture. Furthermore, all of these issues are
inherent to text-based transformations, and essentially cannot be
fixed from within the paradigm. \emph{Overall, code transformations
  should never operate at the level of text.}

\Desc{Discussion} C++ templates [CITE] are not general-purpose sugars,
because they cannot take code as an argument. Thus you cannot, for
example, express a sugar that takes an expression \Code{e} and expands
it to \Code{e + 1}.

Instead, C++ templates are used
primarily to instantiate polymorphic code by replacing type parameters
with concrete types.  Let's use the following template declaration,
taken from [CITE: pg344], as a running example. It declares a function
to compute the area of a circle, that can be instantiated with
different possible (presumably numeric) types \Code{T}:
\begin{Codes}
template<class T>
T circular_area(T r) \{
  return pi<T> * r * r;
\}
\end{Codes}

Besides function definitions, several other kinds of declarations can
be templated, including methods, classes, structs, and type aliases.
The behavior of each is similar. A template may be invoked by passing
arguments in angle brackets. An invoked template acts like the
kind of thing the template declared, and can be used in the same
positions. Thus, e.g., a \Code{struct} template should be invoked in type
position; and our running function template example should be invoked
in expression position to make a function, which can then be called:
\begin{Codes}
  float area = circular_area<float>(1);
\end{Codes}
When a template is invoked like this, a copy of the template
definition is made, with the template parameters replaced with the
concrete arguments.\marginpar{
  If a template is invoked multiple times with the same parameters,
  only one copy of the code will be made, however.
}
In our example, this produces the code:
\begin{Codes}
float circular_area(float r) \{
  return pi<float> * r * r;
\}
\end{Codes}

So far we have only described type parameters, but templates can also
take other kinds of parameters, including primitive values (such as
numbers) and other templates. The ability to manipulate numbers and
invoke other templates at compile time make C++ templates powerful
and, unsurprisingly, Turing complete. However, templates \emph{cannot}
be parameterized over code, and thus are not general-purpose sugars.
For example, most of the examples in this thesis cannot be written as
C++ templates.

Template expansion uses IO evaluation order. This is important because
it is possible
to define both a generic template, that applies most of the time, and
a specialized template, that applies if a parameter has a particular
value. For example, this could be used to make a \Code{HashMap} use a different
implementation if its keys are \Code{int}s. Thus it is important that
a template see the concrete type (e.g. \Code{int}) that is passed to
it, even if this type is the result of another template expansion.

    "Lisp programmers have long used macros to extend their language.
    Indeed, their success has inspired macro notations for a variety
    of other languages, such as C and Java.  There is, however, a
    paucity of effective pedagogic examples of macro use.  This paper
    presents a short, non-trivial example that implements a construct
    not already found in mainstream languages.  Furthermore, it
    motivates the need for tail-calls, as opposed to mere
    tail-recursion, and illustrates how support for tail-call
    optimization is crucial to support a natural style of macro-based
    language extension."

  abstract=
    "Generative programming is widely used both to develop new
    programming languages and to extend existing ones with
    domain-specific sub-languages.  This paper describes {\sf
    McMicMac}, a framework for generative programming.  {\sf McMicMac}
    uses tree-transforming macros as language specifications, and
    enhances them with inherited and synthesized attributes.  The
    enhanced transformers can describe general compilation tasks.
    Families of these specifications are grouped into mixin-like
    collections called vocabularies.  Programmers can defined new
    languages by composing these vocabularies.  We have implemented
    {\sf McMicMac} for Scheme and used it to build several systems,
    including the DrScheme programming environment.  The principles of
    {\sf McMicMac} carry over to other languages and environments."
